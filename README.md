# LearnGo

A personal repository to document my Go learning journey.

## Resources

Here are some excellent resources I'm using to learn Go:

- ðŸ“˜ [Learn Go with Tests (quii)](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world) â€” Test-driven approach to learning Go.
- ðŸš€ [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) â€” Official interactive Go tour from the creators of Go.
- ðŸ’¡ [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/values) â€” Practical, example-driven Go snippets and explanations.

> This repo will contain notes, exercises, and experiments as I progress through each resource.
